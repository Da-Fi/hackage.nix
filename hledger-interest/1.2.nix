        description = "hledger-interest is a small command-line utility based on Simon\nMichael's hleder library. Its purpose is to compute interest for a\ngiven ledger account. Using command line flags, the program can be\nconfigured to use various schemes for day-counting, such as act\\/act,\n30\\/360, 30E\\/360, and 30\\/360isda. Furthermore, it supports a (small)\nnumber of interest schemes, i.e. annual interest with a fixed rate and\nthe scheme mandated by the German BGB288 (Basiszins für\nVerbrauchergeschäfte). Extending support for other schemes is fairly\neasy, but currently requires changes to the source code.\n\nAs an example, consider the following loan, stored in a file called\n@test.ledger@:\n\n> 2008/09/26 Loan\n>     Assets:Bank          EUR 10000.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2008/11/27 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank          EUR -3771.12\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2009/05/03 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank          EUR -1200.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2010/12/10 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank          EUR -3700.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n\nSuppose that loan earns 5% interest per year, and payments amortize\ninterest before amortizing the principal claim, then the resulting\nledger would look like this:\n\n> \$ hledger-interest --file=test.ledger --source=Expenses:Interest --target=Liabilities:Loan --30-360 --annual=0.05 Liabilities:Loan\n> 2008/09/26 Loan\n>     Assets:Bank              EUR  10000.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2008/11/27 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank              EUR  -3771.12\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2008/11/27 5.00% interest for EUR -10000.00 over 61 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR    -84.72\n>     Expenses:Interest\n>\n> 2008/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -6313.60 over 34 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR    -29.81\n>     Expenses:Interest\n>\n> 2009/05/03 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank              EUR  -1200.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2009/05/03 5.00% interest for EUR -6343.42 over 123 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR   -108.37\n>     Expenses:Interest\n>\n> 2009/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -5251.78 over 238 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR   -173.60\n>     Expenses:Interest\n>\n> 2010/12/10 Payment\n>     Assets:Bank              EUR  -3700.00\n>     Liabilities:Loan\n>\n> 2010/12/10 5.00% interest for EUR -5425.38 over 340 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR   -256.20\n>     Expenses:Interest\n>\n> 2010/12/31 5.00% interest for EUR -1981.58 over 21 days\n>     Liabilities:Loan         EUR     -5.78\n>     Expenses:Interest\n\nRunning the utility with @--help@ gives a brief overview over the\navailable options:\n\n> Usage: hledger-interest [OPTION...] ACCOUNT\n>   -h          --help            print this message and exit\n>   -V          --version         show version number and exit\n>   -v          --verbose         echo input ledger to stdout (default)\n>   -q          --quiet           don't echo input ledger to stdout\n>               --today           update account until today\n>   -f FILE     --file=FILE       input ledger file\n>   -s ACCOUNT  --source=ACCOUNT  interest source account\n>   -t ACCOUNT  --target=ACCOUNT  interest target account\n>               --act             use 'act' day counting convention\n>               --30-360          use '30/360' day counting convention\n>               --30E-360         use '30E/360' day counting convention\n>               --30E-360isda     use '30E/360isda' day counting convention\n>               --constant=RATE   constant interest rate\n>               --annual=RATE     annual interest rate\n>               --bgb288          compute interest according to German BGB288";
