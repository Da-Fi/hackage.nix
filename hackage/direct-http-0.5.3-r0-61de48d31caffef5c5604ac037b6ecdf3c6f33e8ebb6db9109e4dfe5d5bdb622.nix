      description = "This package is a native implementation of the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\nIt lives as a library, exporting an interface reminiscent of CGI or FastCGI.\nThus policy on how namespace is mapped to files and/or scripts is entirely up\nto the client application.\n\nThis package is partially compatible with direct-fastcgi by the same\nauthor, but is intended more by way of a replacement for it than a companion\nto it, and makes several design decisions differently.  The biggest is the\nuse of MonadControlBase for exceptions.\n\n[Version 0.5.3] Actually works with extension headers, by admitting the\nreality that they can occur anytime and not just with an entity.\n\n[Version 0.5.2] Actually works with daemonization, by using a feature of\ndirect-daemon added for this purpose to open the socket after forking but\nbefore dropping privileges.\n\n[Version 0.5.1] Uses SafeSemaphore, which is the future, rather than QSem\nfrom base, which is deprecated.\n\n[Version 0.5.0.1] This preliminary release is a preview to gauge community\ninterest.  Not even all major features are implemented; things that exist\nonly as stubs include encryption, compression, chunking, and reading back\ncookies.  Nonetheless it may be useful if run behind a reverse proxy that\nprovides the missing features transparently, such as Apache.";
